# Bandit Level 15 â†’ Level 16

## Overview

In this challenge (Level 15), our goal is to connect securely to the local service on port 30001
 using an SSL/TLS client (`openssl s_client`), provide the Level 15 password, and retrieve the 
 Level 16 password from the service response.

## Objective

* SSH into **bandit15**
* Establish an SSL/TLS connection to the service on port 30001
* Supply the Level 15 password
* Capture the Level 16 password from the encrypted service output

## Tools Used

* SSH client (`ssh`)
* OpenSSL command-line tool (`openssl s_client`)

## Steps to Solve

1. **SSH into the bandit15 account**

   ```bash
   ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```

   *Use the password obtained from Level 14.*

2. **Connect to the encrypted service with OpenSSL**

   ```bash
   openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
   ```

3. **Enter the Level 15 password**
   When prompted by the service, paste:

   ```text
   8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
   ```

4. **Read the output**
   The SSL/TLS session will display the Level 16 password at the end of the connection.

## Level 16 Password

## Conclusion

By using `openssl s_client` to establish an SSL/TLS connection to the local service on port 30001 and providing the correct Level 15 credentials, we successfully retrieved the **bandit16** account password. This password can now be used to proceed to Level 16.
