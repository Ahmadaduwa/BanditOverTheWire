# OverTheWire Bandit Level 20 â†’ Level 21

**Difficulty:** - (Medium, involving network communication and understanding local exploits)
**Category:** Network Exploitation

**Challenge Goal:** Obtain the password for the bandit21 user.

**Tools Used:**

* `ssh`
* `ls`
* `nc` (netcat)
* A provided executable (`./suconnect`)

**Steps to Solve:**

1.  **Access bandit20 via SSH (in two terminal windows):**
    ```bash
    ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```
    You establish an SSH connection to the bandit20 server in two separate terminal windows. You will be prompted for the password for bandit20, which is `0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO`.

2.  **Terminal 1: List directory contents:**
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    In the first terminal, you list the files in the current directory. You likely found an executable file named `suconnect`.

3.  **Terminal 1: Execute `suconnect` without arguments:**
    ```bash
    ./suconnect
    ```
    Running `suconnect` without any arguments probably showed some usage instructions or indicated that it expects a port number as an argument.

4.  **Terminal 2: Set up a netcat listener:**
    ```bash
    nc -l 9999
    ```
    In the second terminal, you use `netcat` (`nc`) to set up a listener on port 9999. The `-l` option tells `nc` to listen for incoming connections.

5.  **Terminal 1: Execute `suconnect` with the listening port:**
    ```bash
    ./suconnect 9999
    ```
    In the first terminal, you execute the `suconnect` program, providing the port number 9999 as an argument. This likely caused `suconnect` to attempt a connection to `localhost` (or a similar local address) on the specified port.

6.  **Terminal 1: Enter the bandit20 password:**
    ```
    enter 0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
    ```
    The `suconnect` program likely prompted for the current password (for bandit20). Upon entering the correct password, it probably established a connection to the `nc` listener in the second terminal and sent the password for the next level.

7.  **Terminal 2: Retrieve the password for bandit21:**
    In the second terminal, where `nc` was listening, you would have received the password for bandit21:
    ```
    EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt
    ```

**Conclusion:**

The password for bandit level 21 (`EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt`) was obtained by exploiting a local program (`suconnect`) that likely attempts to establish a network connection and transmit sensitive information after receiving the correct current password. By setting up a local `netcat` listener, we intercepted this transmitted information and retrieved the password for the next level.
