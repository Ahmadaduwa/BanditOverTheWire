## OverTheWire Bandit Level 33 â†’ The End (of the main track)

**Difficulty:** Very Easy

**Category:** File Reading, Conclusion

**Challenge Goal:** Reach the end of the main Bandit game track and read the final message in the `README.txt` file.

**Tools Used:**
* `ssh`
* `ls`
* `cat`

### Methodology and Steps
We are at Bandit Level 33. This level typically serves as the conclusion to the main Bandit wargame series. 
The objective is to reach this point and find the final message left by the game administrators.

1.  **Access bandit33 via SSH:**
    Log in to the server using the password for `bandit33` (`tQdtbs5D5i2vJwkO8mEyYEyTL8izoeJ0`).
    ```bash
    ssh bandit33@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```

2.  **Examine the Home Directory:**
    List the files in the current directory (the home directory of `bandit33`).
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    This command will show a file named `README.txt`.

3.  **Read the README File:**
    View the content of the `README.txt` file. This file contains the final message for players 
    who have completed the main Bandit game.
    ```bash
    cat README.txt
    ```
    The content of this file is the concluding message from the OverTheWire team.

Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

Since I didn't want to write the report myself, I used AI to write it all. 
By telling the AI what I found and how I solved it, the AI then wrote the well-designed article for me to put on GitHub. 
All of this is to keep track of my learning history.
