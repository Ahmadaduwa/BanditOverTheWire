## OverTheWire Bandit Level 25 â†’ Level 26 

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Category:** SSH, Restricted Shells, Text Editor Exploitation

**Challenge Goal:** Find the password for the user `bandit26` by 
using a provided SSH key and escaping a restricted environment.

**Tools Used:**
* `ssh`
* `ls`
* `grep`
* `cat`
* `vi`/`vim` (exploited via the restricted program)

### Methodology and Steps
We begin as user `bandit25`. The challenge provides us with a file that appears to 
be an SSH key for the next level. We need to use this key to access `bandit26` and then 
find their password, likely by navigating a restricted environment.

1.  **Access bandit25 via SSH:**
    Log in to the server using the password for `bandit25` (`iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4`).
    ```bash
    ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```

2.  **Examine the Home Directory:**
    List the contents of the current directory upon logging in.
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    We see a file named `bandit26.sshkey`. This is almost certainly the private key
     required to log in as `bandit26`.

3.  **Attempt to SSH as bandit26 using the Key:**
    Try to log in as user `bandit26` on `localhost` (since Bandit levels usually 
    require local access before external) using the discovered SSH key.
    ```bash
    ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost -p 2220
    ```
    This command should successfully log you in, but you will likely land in a restricted 
    environment, not a standard shell. The prompt or the output might look unusual.

4.  **Investigate the User's Shell (Optional but good practice):**
    While logged in as `bandit23` (in a separate session or before logging in as `bandit26`), 
    you could check the shell assigned to `bandit26` in `/etc/passwd`.
    ```bash
    grep bandit26 /etc/passwd
    ```
    This would likely show that `bandit26`'s shell is set to a custom program, such as `/usr/bin/showtext`.

5.  **Inspect the Restricted Program:**
    View the content or description of the program assigned as `bandit26`'s shell (e.g., `/usr/bin/showtext`).
    ```bash
    cat /usr/bin/showtext
    ```
    Looking at the code for `/usr/bin/showtext` would reveal that it's likely a script or 
    program designed to display a specific text file, often using a text editor like `vi` or `vim` in read-only mode.

6.  **Exploit the Text Editor:**
    When you SSH into `bandit26` using the key (Step 3), the `/usr/bin/showtext` program 
    executes and presents you with text within what appears to be a text editor interface 
    (like `vi` or `vim`). The program restricts what you can do, but the underlying editor 
    itself has powerful features, including the ability to escape to a shell.

    * Ensure you are in command mode (press `Esc`).
    * Press `v`. This might enter visual mode or, in some restricted setups, break into a 
    state where standard editor commands are available.
    * Enter the command `:set shell=/bin/bash`. This is a standard `vi`/`vim` command that 
    changes the default shell used for shell escapes to `/bin/bash`. Type `:` followed by `set shell=/bin/bash` and press `Enter`.
    * Enter the command `:shell`. This is another standard `vi`/`vim` command that executes 
    the shell defined by the `shell` option. Type `:` followed by `shell` and press `Enter`.

    This sequence should drop you into a standard bash shell running as the user `bandit26`.

7.  **Retrieve the Password:**
    Now that you have a full shell as `bandit26`, you can read their password file.
    ```bash
    cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
    ```
    This command will output the password for the next level.

### Conclusion:
This level teaches the importance of using provided credentials (the SSH key) 
and recognizing restricted shell environments. By inspecting the program that 
serves as the restricted shell (`/usr/bin/showtext`) and identifying that it 
utilizes an interactive text editor like `vi` or `vim`, we can leverage the
editor's built-in shell escape features (`:set shell` and `:shell`) to break 
out of the restricted environment and gain access to a standard shell under 
the `bandit26` user, allowing us to retrieve the password.
