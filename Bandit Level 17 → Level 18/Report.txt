# OverTheWire Bandit Level 17 â†’ Level 18

**Difficulty:** - (Implicitly easy, based on the straightforward solution)
**Category:** Password Retrieval

**Challenge Goal:** Obtain the password for the bandit18 user.

**Tools Used:**

* `ssh`
* `diff`

**Steps to Solve:**

1.  **Access bandit17 via SSH:**
    ```bash
    ssh -i bandit17ssh.txt bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```
    This command establishes a secure shell connection to the bandit17 server using the provided private key `bandit17ssh.txt` on port 2220.

2.  **Examine the differences between password files:**
    ```bash
    diff passwords.new passwords.old
    ```
    The challenge description for Level 17 hints that the password for the next level is stored in a file named `passwords.new` and that the previous password is in `passwords.old`. The `diff` command highlights the differences between these two files.

3.  **Identify the new password:**
    The output of the `diff` command reveals the following:
    ```
    42c42
    < x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
    ---
    > C6XNBdYOkgt5ARXESMKWWOUwBeaIQZ0Y
    ```
    The line starting with `<` indicates the content unique to `passwords.new`, which is the password for bandit18: `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`.

4.  **Attempt SSH connection to bandit18:**
    ```bash
    ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```
    This command initiates an SSH connection to the bandit18 server.

5.  **Authenticate with the retrieved password:**
    When prompted for the password, enter `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`.

6.  **Verification of Success:**
    If the authentication is successful, you will receive a welcome message and the level will be considered solved. The "byeBye" message you mentioned likely confirms a successful login.

**Conclusion:**

The password for bandit level 18 was successfully retrieved by comparing the contents of the `passwords.new` and `passwords.old` files using the `diff` command. This password was then used to establish an SSH connection to the bandit18 user, completing the challenge.
