# Bandit Level 13 â†’ Level 14

## Overview

In this challenge (Level 13), our goal is to retrieve the password for the `bandit14` 
account by utilizing a private SSH key located in the `bandit13` user's directory. 
After obtaining the key, we will use it to establish an SSH connection to the server 
and extract the password for Level 14.

## Objective
