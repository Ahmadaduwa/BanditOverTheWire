# OverTheWire Bandit Level 21 â†’ Level 22

**Difficulty:** - (Medium, requires understanding cron jobs and shell scripts)
**Category:** Scheduled Tasks / Cron Jobs

**Challenge Goal:** Obtain the password for the bandit22 user.

**Tools Used:**

* `ssh`
* `ls`
* `cat`

**Steps to Solve:**

1.  **Access bandit21 via SSH:**
    ```bash
    ssh bandit21@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```
    Establish a secure shell connection to the bandit21 server using the password `EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt`.

2.  **List scheduled cron jobs:**
    ```bash
    ls /etc/cron.d/
    ```
    Investigate the `/etc/cron.d/` directory, which is a common location for system-wide cron jobs. 
    This reveals files defining scheduled tasks for different Bandit levels.

3.  **Examine the bandit22 cron job file:**
    ```bash
    cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
    ```
    Read the contents of the `cronjob_bandit22` file. This file defines when and how the script 
    for this level's challenge is executed. It typically shows the schedule and the path to the executable script.

4.  **Inspect the cron job script:**
    ```bash
    cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
    ```
    Read the contents of the script executed by the cron job. This script contains the logic 
    that runs periodically. It is common for these scripts to perform actions related to the 
    next level's password. In this case, the script likely reads the current level's password
     and writes the next level's password to a specific location, often a temporary file with a 
     predictable or generated name. The script's output or comments would reveal the location of the next password.

5.  **Retrieve the password from the temporary file:**
    ```bash
    cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
    ```
    Based on the information found in the cron job script (`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh`),
     navigate to the temporary file where the password for bandit22 is stored and read its 
     contents using `cat`. The script indicated the password was written to `/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`.

6.  **Obtain the password for bandit22:**
    The output of the previous command is the password for the next level:
    ```
    tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q
    ```

**Conclusion:**

The password for bandit level 22 (`tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q`) was found by 
examining the system's scheduled tasks. By inspecting the cron job file for bandit22 
(`/etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22`) and the script it executes (`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh`),
 we discovered that the script periodically writes the bandit22 password to a temporary file 
 (`/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`), from which we were able to retrieve it.
