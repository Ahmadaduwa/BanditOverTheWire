## OverTheWire Bandit Level 27 â†’ Level 28

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Category:** Git

**Challenge Goal:** Find the password for the user `bandit28` by interacting with a Git repository.

**Tools Used:**
* `ssh`
* `mkdir`
* `cd`
* `git clone`
* `ls`
* `cat`

### Methodology and Steps

We start as user `bandit27`. The challenge involves a Git repository accessible locally. 
We need to clone this repository and inspect its contents to find the password for the next level.

1.  **Access bandit27 via SSH:**
    Log in to the server using the password for `bandit27` (`upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB`).
    ```bash
    ssh bandit27@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```

2.  **Create a Working Directory:**
    It's good practice to create a temporary directory to clone the repository into, 
    keeping things organized.
    ```bash
    mkdir /tmp/level27_git
    cd /tmp/level27_git
    ```
    (Using `/tmp/level27_git` to avoid potential conflicts if `/tmp/level27` was used 
    in a previous level).

3.  **Clone the Git Repository:**
    The challenge likely provides information about a Git repository accessible via SSH. 
    The format `ssh://user@host:port/path/to/repo` is typical for Git over SSH. Based on the 
    previous level and common Bandit patterns, the repository is probably hosted locally (`localhost`)
     and accessible to a dedicated `git` user associated with `bandit27`.
    ```bash
    git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo
    ```
    When prompted for a password, use the password for `bandit27` (`upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB`). 
    In this setup, the `bandit27` user's password is also used for the `bandit27-git` SSH access for Git operations.

4.  **Explore the Cloned Repository:**
    Navigate into the newly cloned repository directory (which will likely be named `repo`).
    ```bash
    ls
    cd repo/
    ls
    ```
    Listing the contents of the `repo` directory will show the files within the repository. 
    A common place to find challenge information or passwords is in a `README` file.

5.  **Read the README File:**
    View the content of the `README` file.
    ```bash
    cat README
    ```
    The password for the next level (`bandit28`) is typically placed within this 
    file in Git-based Bandit levels.

### Password for Level 28: Yz9IpL0sBcCeuG7m9uQFt8ZNpS4HZRcN

### Conclusion: 
This level introduces Git interaction via SSH. By identifying the location and credentials for the Git repository (`bandit27-git@localhost`), we were able to clone it. Navigating the contents of the cloned repository revealed the password for the next level stored in the `README` file. This level reinforces the importance of checking for version control repositories when exploring a system and understanding how to interact with them.
